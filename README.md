## Project Goals

### **1. API Development**

- Build RESTful APIs for managing job postings, categories, and applications.
- Ensure efficient and scalable endpoints.

### **2. Access Control**

- Implement **role-based authentication** for admins and users (job seekers).
- Secure API endpoints with **JWT-based authentication**.

### **3. Database Efficiency**

- Optimize job search queries using **indexing and query optimization techniques**.
- Implement **advanced filtering** for jobs based on location, industry, and type.

**Create suoeruser (for access to admin protected endpoint and admin dashboard)**
If you need admin access, create a Django superuser by following below commands:

```bash
# Start a bash terminal to execute commands 
docker exec -it job_board_platform-web bash

# Create superuser and Follow the prompts to enter:
Python3 manage.py createsuperuser

```

### Access the API
After setup, the API should be available at:
- API Base URL: http://localhost:8000/api/
- Admin Panel: http://localhost:8000/admin/
