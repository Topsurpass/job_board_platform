## Project Goals

### **1. API Development**

- Build RESTful APIs for managing job postings, categories, and applications.
- Ensure efficient and scalable endpoints.

### **2. Access Control**

- Implement **role-based authentication** for admins and users (job seekers).
- Secure API endpoints with **JWT-based authentication**.

### **3. Database Efficiency**

- Optimize job search queries using **indexing and query optimization techniques**.
- Implement **advanced filtering** for jobs based on location, industry, and type.

## Technologies Used

| **Technology** | **Purpose**                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Django**     | High-level Python framework for rapid backend development  |
| **MySQL** | Database for storing job board data with optimized queries |
| **JWT**        | Secure authentication mechanism for role-based access      |
| **Swagger and Redoc**    | API endpoint documentation and testing      
| **Docker**  | Containerization for easy deployment and scalability  |               |

## Key Features

### **1. Job Posting Management**

- CRUD operations for job postings (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Categorization of jobs by **industry, location, and type**.

### **2. Role-Based Authentication**

- **Admins**: Manage jobs, categories, and oversee platform operations.
- **Users**: Search for jobs, apply, and manage applications.

### **3. Optimized Job Search**

- **Indexing & optimized queries** for fast filtering.
- **Advanced filtering**: Location-based, industry-based, and keyword-based search.

### **4. API Documentation**

- **Swagger and Redoc UI** for detailed API documentation.
- Hosted at `/api/docs` for frontend integration and developer reference.

### **5. Containerization & Deployment**  
- **Dockerfile** for containerizing the application.  
- **Docker Compose** to manage the database and API services.  
- Supports **scalable deployment** in cloud environments.
